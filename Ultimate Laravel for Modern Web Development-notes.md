## Ultimate Laravel for Modern Web Development Book Notes:

1. The two ways in which the IoC container
   can resolve dependencies are Closure callbacks and automatic resolution. (p.26)

2. It is also a good practice to configure a fallback language. This should be
   configured in the config/app.php configuration file.
   The syntax to set a fallback language is as follows:
   `falback_locale` => `<language>`\
   An example, to set the fallback language as English:\
   `falback_locale` => `en`
   (p.30)

3. The directory location of composer can be found using the following command:\
   `composer global about`

4. Artisan is the powerful Command-Line Interface (CLI) included with Laravel.

5. Types of Routers\
   There are four main types of routers which are extensively used in Laravel:
   - Redirect routes
   - View routes
   - Route list
   - Fallback routes
